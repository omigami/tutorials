    "If you've ever analysed Mass Spectrometry data, you might have come across the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking [GNPS](https://gnps-external.ucsd.edu/gnpslibrary) site. It's a wonderful resource, offering a powerful platform where you can upload your data and get back results. But sometimes, it's more useful to download their data and work with it directly. \n",

    "\n",
    "This article is a guide to using Jupyter Notebook, Python, and Pandas to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get the main “ALL_GNPS” dataset: a 4GB JSON collection of all publicly available mass spectrometry data in GNPS, including peaks, assignments, and structures;\n",
    "* Load it into a Pandas dataframe;;\n",
    "* Understand all the columns and how best to work with them;\n",
    "* Normalize and clean the data and understand some caveats;\n",
    "* Understanding the InChI and Smiles columns and their hashed indexes;\n",
    "* Finding unique and partially unique rows using the InChIKey;\n",
    "* Analyze the peaks by generating histograms;\n",
    "* This guide will get you comfortable with the dataset’s structure; show you how to manipulate the data; and provide a good base for your own specific problems.\n"
